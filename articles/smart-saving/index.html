        <p>There are many reasons to save and we should all aim to have savings appropriate to our situation and goals.  If we have savings there is less likelihood of our needing to borrow money at rates which will ultimately mean we have less money.  To decide how to save and how much to save it is useful to set some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> saving goals.</p>
<h2>What is SMART Saving?</h2>
<p>To help focus on our saving it is useful to think about what we are saving for, the time period over which we will be saving, how much we need, etc.  Setting SMART saving goals can help us to decide upon and reach those goals:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Specific</dt>
  <dd>
    The more clearly goals are defined the more focussed we can be on working towards them.
    <ul>
      <li>What do we want to achieve with the goal?</li>
      <li>Why do we want to save for the goal?</li>
      <li>How are we going to save?</li>
      <li>Where are we going to put the savings?</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Measurable</dt>
  <dd>
    If we have something to measure then we have something to track our progress against and determine if we have met our goal.
    <ul>
      <li>How much do we need to save?</li>
      <li>How often do we want to save?</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Achievable</dt>
  <dd>It is important to work out if it is actually possible for us to save this much given our current situation.  If not then it help us work on improving our situation so that we can achieve this goal or to look at other options.</dd>
  <dt>Relevant</dt>
  <dd>We should look at our wider life to determine how relevant this saving goal is to us.  E.g. Is it worth saving for a car, if we know that we'll be leaving the country before or shortly after we have the money for it?</dd>
  <dt>Time-Bound</dt>
  <dd>
    Knowing when we want to achieve a goal by gives us something to help track our progress towards it and work out if we have met it.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Examples of Types of Saving</h2>
<p>To demonstrate how SMART saving goals can be created here are a few examples.</p>
<h3>Emergency Fund</h3>
<p>Alice want to save money in case of an unexpected expense such as the boiler breaking, a major car repair bill or losing her job.  The biggest likely need she would have could be losing her job and she thinks that it could take up to six months to find another job.  Therefore she sets a goal to have enough to cover six months <a href="/articles/how-to-identify-essential-expenses/">essential expenses</a> saved away.</p>
<p>Her essential expenses for one person come to £850/month, therefore she wants to save £5,100.  She would like to have this in savings within one year.  However, she work out that she can only save £220/month at the moment so this would be unrealistic.  Therefore she revise the goal to three months of expenses for the time being.  This gives a realistic goal and she decides to revisit her expenses and earnings in one month to see how she can meet her ideal goal.</p>
<p>She decides to set up an automated payment to transfer £220/month from her current account into an easy access saving account so that it benefits from a little interest while still being able to quickly withdraw if needed.  Automating the payment creates a good spending habit and keeps her disciplined by reducing the temptation to spend the money elsewhere.  This also makes it easy to track her progress towards her goal.</p>
<h3>Pension</h3>
<p>Fred is 30 and would like to retire at 68.  He has a mortgage which should be paid off before he retires, therefore he predicts that he should only need about £13,000/year in retirement.  Under the current system he assumes he should get a state pension of around £8,546/year.  He pays 2% of his pay into his workplace pension scheme and his employer pays 3%, which is predicted to return £1,207/year at retirement.  This would give him £9,753 in total and therefore he has a shortfall of £3,302 a year.  He has used the <a href="https://www.standardlife.co.uk/c1/guides-and-calculators/pension-calculator.page">pension calculator</a> supplied by his workplace's pension provider to work out that he needs to increase his contributions from 2% (£24/month) of his pay, to 16% (£194/month) of his pay.  He has calculated that he can afford this by trimming back on a few of his <a href="/articles/putting-spending-on-luxuries-into-perspective/">luxuries</a> and doing a small amount of <a href="/articles/boosting-our-finances-with-overtime/">overtime</a> each month.  He has chosen to use his company's pension scheme rather than start a separate pension because it is convenient for him and because he feels more comfortable with their managing it for him rather than using something like a SIPP.</p>
<h3>Current Account Buffer</h3>
<p>Hilary wants to keep a certain amount of money in his current account to act as a buffer.  This prevent him from going overdrawn and smooths over expenses that vary from one month to the next.  It also means that he can make use of special offers in supermarkets to save money.</p>
<p>He has worked out that his typical monthly expenses vary by no more than £500 on average over the year.  He has therefore decided to keep twice that as a buffer.  This is a high priority for him so he is going to cut back on luxuries and do overtime for the next 2.5 months to save towards his £1,000 target.  Once he has achieved this balance he is going to set a further goal to monitor it every week and plan any action needed to make sure it doesn't fall below £500 and is over £1,000 after every pay day.</p>
<h2>What Next?</h2>
<p>Now we can start creating goals with a sense of purpose and a strategy to achieve them.  By having clearly defined goals we are much more likely to be successful and have much greater control over our money.</p>
