It is more difficult than it has been, but it is still possible to buy a house in large parts of the country, even on a low wage.  It does however require a plan.  A young couple renting in Bristol want a place of their own, here is how they could go about it.  Bristol is quite a good area to use as an example because house prices and rent are relatively high both here and in the surrounding area, but not as extreme as London.  Therefore what works here would work in most parts of the country and in many areas would be much easier.

## Income
The couple both work 35 hours a week for £8/hr, which is a little more than the current minimum wage, but less than the proposed minimum wage from April 2019.  This gives them a joint income of £29,120.  After tax, NI and workplace pension (4% from April 2019) they are left with: £25,401.  Throughout the year they may be able to earn a little extra through [overtime](/articles/boosting-our-finances-with-overtime/) but this will be unpredictable.

## Mortgage
The couple look into how much they are likely to be able to borrow and assuming 4 times their joint income it is likely to be around £116,000 as they have no debts and a good credit history.  However, they will assume a little lower at £110,000 to be surer in their plans.  If the mortgage rate was 3.9% over 25 years then the repayment would be £575/month.  This is much less than the £800/month they are currently paying in rent.

## Houses Near Bristol
House prices in Bristol are expensive and they think it is unlikely that they will be able to afford one here.  So they accept they are going to have to look a bit further out.  The couple find that they can buy a [2/3 bed houses within 15 miles of Bristol for £140,000](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/find.html?locationIdentifier=REGION%5E93829&minBedrooms=2&maxPrice=140000&radius=15.0&propertyTypes=bungalow%2Cdetached%2Csemi-detached%2Cterraced%2Cflat&includeSSTC=false&dontShow=retirement%2CsharedOwnership).  Assuming that they can get a mortgage for £110,000 then they would need a deposit of £30,000.  If house prices or interest rates rise then naturally the other figures will rise as well.

We can see what the couple consider their essential expenses below, including their biggest expense, the place they rent together for £800/month.  Total essential expenses come to £18,410/year or £1,534/month, which when taken from their joint take-home pay leaves £6,991/year or £582/month left to work with.

They might be able to reduce their essential expenses a little with the duel-fuel payments, mobile contracts, broadband and food bills, but they don't have much other room to reduce essential expenses in total.

## The Plan

They put together a plan to work out what they need and how they're going to save for it.  Each pay day they will allocate money to their essential expenses, savings and non-essential expenses.

### Emergency Savings - Current/Easy Access Savings Account
They have £1,000 in their current account at the moment and are going to start by building an emergency fund.  They need an emergency fund separate from their deposit savings as without this they would pay penalties on their LISA (see below) if they had to withdraw from it without using it for a house purchase.  The emergency fund is also important to prevent them from having to take a loan if they temporarily run out of money.  Their biggest risk is losing a job. Because they both work and they are at different places, they decide that 2 months worth of essential expenses should be enough.  This would come to £3,068.

This is a high priority for them and want to do it as quickly as possible.  They have £582/month left over after essential expenses are paid for so they decide to save £400/month into an easy access saving account, leaving them with £182/month for non-essentials.  They have £1,000 in their current account, which they'll aim to maintain and therefore have £2,068 left to save, so it will take them just over 5 months to reach their emergency savings target.  They have just got Christmas out of the way and are confident that they can stick with this as it is only for 5 months.


### Planned Non-Essential Spending
They want to put money aside for Christmas, birthdays, a holiday, etc.  They have told their relatives about their plans to buy a house so that they understand that they will be cutting back on their spending.  They have plans to spend £720/year on this and will therefore keep back £60/month from their money for non-essentials.  They will keep this in a separate saving account.


### House Deposit - Lifetime ISA

  function drawChart() {
    var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
    data.addColumn('string', 'Use');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Amount');

      ['Essential expenses', 18410],
      ['LISA deposits', 4400],
      ['Unplanned non-essentials', 1931],
      ['Planned non-essentials', 720],
    ]);
    var options = {'title':'Yearly Budget While Saving in LISA',
                   'width':600,
                   'height':500};
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('lisa_budget_chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
</script>
<div class="pull-right" id="lisa_budget_chart_div"></div>

They want to make the most of the help that the government can provide and opt for a Lifetime ISA (LISA), which can only be used to buy a house or retire.  You can deposit up to £4,000/year in each person's LISA and the government will put in a 25% bonus on your contributions for each tax year.  So if you put in £1,000 each year, the government will add £250 giving you £1,250 each tax year.

They are aiming for a deposit of £30,000  They realise that this is going to take significant sacrifice and a steady commitment to achieve.  It can be done however.  They couldn't sustain the saving rate they used to create the emergency fund, but if they save £370/month into their LISA this will give them £4,400/year.  The government will put in an additional bonus of 25% a year on those contributions, giving £5,550 each year in total.  Therefore it will take about 5 &frac12; years to save for their deposit.  During this time they will have £212/month to spend on non-essentials.

### Additional Buying Costs - Savings account
The couple estimate that the cost of legal fees, surveys, moving, etc could come to about £3,000.  They decide to save for this last as their plan is over quite a few years and the LISA will make the biggest difference to their ability to save, but their is no guarantee that future governments will maintain it.  It therefore makes sense to benefit from it while they can.  Once they have their deposit saved, they can put £370/month into a savings account for just over 8 months to cover their additional buying costs.  During this time they will have £212/month to spend on non-essentials.

### Monthly Sweep
At the end of each month, before they are paid, they have decided to transfer any unallocated money over the £1,000 that they want to keep in their current account to their emergency fund account.  If the emergency fund rises to 3 months essential expenses then they will transfer instead to their LISA.  This is where being frugal and any additional money from overtime will really make a difference to speed-up their plan.

### Risks
There are any number of things that could make keeping to the plan more difficult.  It will require a certain amount of luck and a lot of hard work to achieve.  There are two main factors that could throw the plan off:
* The arrival of a baby.  Hopefully this will be welcome and although it will probably result in a drop in income, because they are low-earners much of that will be made up through child benefit and child-tax credits.
* The loss of a job or inability to work.  This could be a real problem.  Although they have made significant sacrifices and been responsible, if they have savings over £16,000 and one loses their job they won't be entitled to any benefits to help them.  Hopefully they will be able to work around this as they have their emergency fund to fall back on and they'd have to be very unlucky for them both to lose their jobs at the same time.

### Summary of Plan
* Save £60/month for planned non-essentials such as Christmas, birthdays, a holiday, etc
* Create emergency fund of £3,068 by saving £400/month over 5 months to top-up existing £1,000 in savings
* Save for deposit of £30,000 in LISA by saving £370/month over 5 &frac12; years and making use of extra 25% each tax year from the government
* Save for additional buying costs of £3,000 by saving £370/month just over 8 months
* Sweep unallocated money from current account each month into emergency fund or LISA

## Where Now?
It is impossible to predict the future, particularly over the time period that this plan will require.  Changes to house prices, interest rates, inflation, tax, minimum wage, have all been ignored because there is no way that we can know how these will change.  The plan has to be regularly revisited.  Opportunities such as better saving interest rates need to be grasped.

Working towards [better paying jobs](/articles/even-small-hourly-wage-increases-make-a-difference/) will probably make the biggest difference and should be taken seriously as if they could both earn even an extra £1/hour, this would come to an extra £3,640/year or £303/month - reducing the time to achieve their plan by over 9 months.

Now that the plan has been created it is clear that it can be done and they now need to take the first steps on what will be a long road, but with hard work and a bit of luck they will reach their goal and be able to buy a place of their own.
