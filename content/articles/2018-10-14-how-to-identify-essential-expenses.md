To really understand our finances we need to understand what are _essential_ expenses for us, expenses that we have to pay.  By identifying those we can work out our minimum expenses and then plan our finances around that.  This creates a good foundation around which to create a budget.

## Record our Essential Expenses

<script type="text/javascript">
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
    data.addColumn('string', 'Expense');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Amount');
    data.addRows([
      ['Rent', 10800],
      ['Food', 3120],
      ['Council Tax', 2064],
      ['Petrol', 1498],
      ['Duel-fuel payment', 800],
      ['Water/Sewage', 420],
      ['Broadband/Telephone', 372],
      ['Car Insurance', 291],
      ['Clothes', 260],
      ['Bus Fares', 180],
      ['TV Licence', 148],
      ['Car Tax', 140],
      ['MOT & Service', 120],
      ['House Insurance', 108],
    ]);
    var options = {'title':'Essential Expenses',
                   'width':600,
                   'height':500};
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);

To begin look over bank and credit card statements for a period of 3-6 months.  If we live with other people, for example in a family that pools its money, then it makes sense to do it for the family rather than just us as an individual.  Note down any payments that are essential and relatively fixed.  To determine whether they are essential decide if you _need_ to pay them or _want_ to.  Below are common essential expenses.

* Rent/Mortgage
* Utilities such as gas, electric, water/sewage, etc (You can normally get a projection for the year that takes into account increased use over winter.)
* Broadband/Telephone
* Council Tax
* Mobile Phone Contract (debatable, but must be paid if contract already exists)
* TV Licence
* Insurance for car, house, etc
* Petrol / public transport costs
* Car Tax
* Car MOT + Service
* Minimum debt repayments

Some expenses are a mix of essential and luxury.  For these try to keep to a minimum for the essential expenses calculation.  The luxuries can always be catered for elsewhere in the budget.
* Clothes
* Food

We need to check for any variance in the figures and factor that in as well as planned expenses that didn't occur during the period analysed.

Exclude expenses which we aren't sure whether we will incur but want to plan for, such as car maintenance, as we can save for these separately.

## Compile Expenditure for Year
Now that we have a record of our essential expenses for a period we can create a picture of our essential expenses for the year.  By adding the amounts together into groups and multiplying it by the number of times that the period analysed occurs in the year.  E.g.  for a period of 3 months we multiple the figures by 4 to represent a year.

Finally we get a table covering our yearly essential expenditure as shown below.  Seeing the figures added up over the year can be quite an eye-opener.

  <tr><th>Purpose</th><th class="text-right">Amount</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Rent</td><td class="text-right">£10,800</td></tr>

## What Next?

Now that we know what are our essential expenses are we can start creating a budget around those.  We may also want to see how we can reduce some of these expenses to make budgeting easier.
