On the face of it, it seems easy to analyse our income.  However, there is sometimes money that we receive that we don't always consider income or factor in when making financial decisions.  There is also money that we receive from time to time which we can't rely on, but is useful to know what we'll do with it if we do.  Therefore it is useful to take a rigorous approach to this.


## Recording our Income

We need to take into account all money coming in.  If we live with other people, for example in a family that pools its money, then it makes sense to do it for the family rather than just us as an individual.  What we are interested in is the money we actually receive so remove any deductions such as tax, national insurance, company pension scheme, etc.  It is useful to split our income into regular and irregular income.

###  Regular Income

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
    data.addColumn('string', 'Source');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Amount');
    data.addRows([
      ['Joint take home pay from jobs', 27000],
      ['Child tax credits', 4680],
      ['Child benefit', 1651],
    ]);
    var options = {'title':'Household Regular Income',
                   'width':500,
                   'height':300};
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('regular_income_chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
</script>
<div class="pull-right" id="regular_income_chart_div"></div>

Income that is reliable and predictable, such as:
* Salary
* Pension
* Rental Income
* Government benefits

Compile all income for the year into a table so that we can see what is coming in.

<table class="table table-bordered hand-written">
  <tr><th>Source</th><th class="text-right">Amount</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Joint take home pay from jobs</td><td class="text-right">£27,000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Child tax credits</td><td class="text-right">£4,680</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Child benefit</td><td class="text-right">£1,651</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Total</th><th class="text-right">£33,331</th></tr>
</table>

### Irregular Income
Income that we know we are likely to get to some degree, but don't know how much or when, such as:
* Overtime at work
* Bonuses from work
* Dividend payments
* Profit from the odd car-boot sale
* Money from parents or other family members

We could compile our irregular income into a table with the minimum and maximum likely amounts.  Depending on how certain we are about the minimum likely amounts we could then include those in our total income calculations.  We can also plan what we'll do if we receive more than our minimum likely amounts - part of this could be used to help stay motivated by treating ourselves as a reward for sticking to a budget.
<table class="table table-bordered hand-written">
  <tr><th>Source</th><th class="text-right">Minimum Likely Amount</th><th class="text-right">Maximum Likely Amount</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Overtime</td><td class="text-right">£220</td><td class="text-right">£840</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Bonus</td><td class="text-right">£120</td><td class="text-right">£540</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Car-boot sale profit</td><td class="text-right">£65</td><td class="text-right">£300</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Total</th><th class="text-right">£625</th><th class="text-right">£1,680</th></tr>
</table>

## Where Now?
Now that we know what we have coming in, we can start making more informed decisions about our finances.  We may plan to [save](/articles/tag/saving/) more, [earn](http://localhost:8780/articles/tag/income/) more, or reduce our [spending](http://localhost:8780/articles/tag/spending/).
