On the face of it, it seems easy to analyse what we earn.  However, there is sometimes money that we receive that we don't always consider our earnings or factor in when making financial decisions.  Therefore it is useful to take a rigorous approach to this.

## Recording our Earnings

We need to take into account all money coming in.  If we live with other people, for example in a family that pools its money, then it makes sense to do it for the family rather than just us as an individual.  This could be from a variety of sources:

* Wages
* Benefits
* Pension
* Dividend Payments
* Money from parents or other family members
* The odd car-boot sale

Don't include money from gambling such as scratch-card wins as they are very unpredictable and can't be relied upon when making decisions.

Remove any deductions such as tax, national insurance, company pension scheme, etc.  Compile all earnings for the year into a table so that we can see what is coming in.

<table class="table table-bordered hand-written">
  <tr><th>Source</th><th class="text-right">Amount</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Joint take home pay from jobs</td><td class="text-right">27,000</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Child tax credits</td><td class="text-right">4,680</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Child benefit</td><td class="text-right">1,651</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Car-boot sale profit</td><td class="text-right">65</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Total</th><th class="text-right">33,396</th></tr>
</table>

Now that we know what we have coming in, we can start making more informed decisions about our finances.  We may plan to [save](/articles/tag/saving/) more, [earn](http://localhost:8780/articles/tag/earning/) more, or reduce our [spending](http://localhost:8780/articles/tag/spending/).
