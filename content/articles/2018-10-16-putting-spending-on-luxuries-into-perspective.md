We all have various [expenses that we have to pay](/articles/how-to-identify-essential-expenses/), but how much do we spend on luxuries?  By taking a good hard look, we may find better ways of using our money, particularly if we would like to spend more in some areas such as saving, holidays, charitable giving, etc.

## How Does Spending on Luxuries Add Up?
Making some rough calculations about our spending on luxuries can help us determine where we can make reductions in spending to help us reach our goals.

<table class="table table-bordered hand-written">
  <tr><th>Luxury</th><th class="text-right">Amount per Month</th><th class="text-right">Amount per Year</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Smoking 20 cigarettes a day<sup>1</sup></td><td class="text-right">335.00</td><td class="text-right">4,015</td</tr>
  <tr><td>Going out once a week for a drink for a couple<sup>2</sup></td><td class="text-right">303.33</td><td class="text-right">3,640</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Going out once a week for a drink for a single person<sup>2</sup></td><td class="text-right">216.67</td><td class="text-right">2,600</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Smoking 10 cigarettes a day<sup>1</sup></td><td class="text-right">167.00</td><td class="text-right">2,007</td</tr>
  <tr><td>Takeaway 1 night a week for a family of 4<sup>3</sup></td><td class="text-right">130.00</td><td class="text-right">1,560</td</tr>
  <tr><td>Bought Sandwiches and Snack for Work for a Couple<sup>4</sup></td><td class="text-right">120</td><td class="text-right">1,440</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Restaurant once  a month for a couple</td><td class="text-right">40.00</td><td class="text-right">480</td</tr>

## What Could we do if we Reduced our Spending in Some Areas?

If we look at how much we can reduce our spending, we can then see how we could use it differently elsewhere.

Below is a possible couple's luxury spending on a few items:

<table class="table table-bordered hand-written">
  <tr><th>Luxury</th><th class="text-right">Amount per Month</th><th class="text-right">Amount per Year</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Smoking 20 cigarettes a day<sup>1</sup></td><td class="text-right">335.00</td><td class="text-right">4,015</td</tr>
  <tr><td>Going out once a week for a drink for a couple<sup>2</sup></td><td class="text-right">303.33</td><td class="text-right">3,640</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Takeaway 1 night a week for a couple<sup>6</sup></td><td class="text-right">86.67</td><td class="text-right">1,040</td</tr>
  <tr><td>Bought Sandwiches and Snack for Work for a Single Person<sup>4</sup></td><td class="text-right">60</td><td class="text-right">720</td></tr>
  <tr><td>A Coffee from a Caf&eacute; 3 times a week<sup>7</sup></td><td class="text-right">6.60</td><td class="text-right">343</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Amazon Prime</td><td class="text-right">7.99</td><td class="text-right">96</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Netflix</td><td class="text-right">7.99</td><td class="text-right">96</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Total</th><th class="text-right">829.17</th><th class="text-right">9,950</th></tr>
</table>

This is a considerable amount spent on luxuries.  When we see how it mounts up we may want to make different choices about what we do with our money.  If we reduce spending in some areas we could:

* Buy a place of our own
* Travel more
* Save and retire early
* Start a business
* Invest it for the future
* Donate more to charity
* The options are endless

Look at how this adds up after a number of years. If the couple can maintain a reduction for a few years and save it away they would have enough to do something significant with it such as put down a deposit on a place of their own.

<table class="table table-bordered hand-written">
  <tr><th>Reduction in Luxury Spending</th><th class="text-right">1 year</th><th class="text-right">3 years</th><th class="text-right">4 years</th><th class="text-right">5 years</th></tr>
  <tr><td>A Third</td><td class="text-right">3,317</td><td class="text-right">9,951</td><td class="text-right">13,268</td><td class="text-right">16,585</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Half</td><td class="text-right">4,975</td><td class="text-right">14,925</td><td class="text-right">19,900</td><td class="text-right">24,875</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Two Thirds</td><td class="text-right">6,633</td><td class="text-right">19,899</td><td class="text-right">26,532</td><td class="text-right">33,165</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Total</td><td class="text-right">9,950</td><td class="text-right">29,850</td><td class="text-right">39,800</td><td class="text-right">49,750</td></tr>

## What Next?
Now that we know what we are spending on luxuries we can start making more considered decisions about the effect our spending is having on our personal finances and on our life and financial goals. We can see where we can reduce our spending or have capacity to increase others such as the amount we save or give to charity. With some of the luxury spending it probably couldn't be excluded all together as for example with restaurants and take-aways you still need to eat even if not in this way. So a decrease in restaurant and take-away spending would mean a smaller increase in supermarket spending. However, now that we have the raw information we can start making those choices.
