There are many different ways of budgeting and some of the most popular use percentages to allocate income towards essentials, non-essentials and savings.  This can be a useful and simple way to help decide how our income should be used.

With these budgets, if we pool our money as a household it generally makes sense to base the budget on the household income and expenses rather than the individual.

## The 60% Solution

    data.addColumn('string', 'Destination');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Allocation');
    data.addRows([
      ['Commited Expenses', 60],
      ['Retirement Savings', 10],
      ['Long-term Savings', 10],
      ['Short-term Savings', 10],
      ['Fun', 10],
    ]);
    var options = {'title':'The 60% solution',
                   'width':500,
                   'height':300};
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('60_solution_chart_div'));

The 60% solution was created by former MSN Money's editor-in-chief, Richard Jenkins.  He found that for him the following allocations of his _gross income_ (before taxes, national insurance, etc) were helpful.

* 60% for **committed expenses** which he defines as all [essentials](/articles/how-to-identify-essential-expenses/) (including all taxes and NI), plus other bills such as satellite contract, gym membership, regular charitable giving, fees for children's clubs, etc.

He lists the remaining 40% in order of priority:

* 10% for **retirement savings**.  This could be a combination of pensions, investments, long term savings, etc.  The point is that it is specifically earmarked for retirement.
* 10% for **long-term savings**.  Part of this could be for an emergency fund with the rest for future big purchases such as a car.  It could also be useful in retirement or indeed to facility retiring early.
* 10% for **short-term savings**.  This money will pay for things like holidays, gifts and other predictable expenses.
* 10% for **fun**.  This can be spent on anything as along as it doesn't exceed 10% of the income



## The 50/20/30 Budget
<script type="text/javascript">
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
    data.addColumn('string', 'Destination');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Allocation');
    data.addRows([
      ['Essentials', 50],
      ['Financial Goals', 20],
      ['Non-essentials', 30],
    ]);
    var options = {'title':'The 50/20/30 budget',
                   'width':500,
                   'height':300};
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('502030_chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
</script>
<div class="pull-right" id="502030_chart_div"></div>

The 50/20/30 budget operates on the _net income_ (after taxes, NI, etc).

* 50% for **[essentials](/articles/how-to-identify-essential-expenses/)** only.  This doesn't include other committed expenses such as gym membership (unless it really is an essential for some reason).
* 20% for **financial goals** such as paying off debt,
      saving for retirement, a new car, etc
* 30% for **[non-essentials](/articles/putting-non-essential-spending-into-perspective/)**

In practice this budget would come out much the same as the 60% solution because by the time we remove part of the income through taxes, NI, etc and move some of the committed expenses such as gym membership over to non-essentials we would end up with similar proportions.


## The 80/20 Budget
<script type="text/javascript">
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = new google.visualization.DataTable();
    data.addColumn('string', 'Destination');
    data.addColumn('number', 'Allocation');
    data.addRows([
      ['Financial Goals', 20],
      ['Everything else', 80],
    ]);
    var options = {'title':'The 80/20 budget',
                   'width':500,
                   'height':300};
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('8020_chart_div'));
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
</script>
<div class="pull-right" id="8020_chart_div"></div>

The 80/20 budget is essentially a simplification of the 50/20/30 budget and again operates on the _net income_.  It is really just a way of emphasising the importance of saving for the future.  Once that's taken care of, then the rest of our spending matters less as long as all the bills are paid.

* 20% for **financial goals** such as paying off debt,
      saving for retirement, a new car, etc
* 80% for **everything else** as long as the bills are paid

This budget really encapsulates the common theme that is running through the above budgets:  we should aim to allocate at least 20% of our income towards retirement/long-term savings.



## Examples of a Low Income Couple Using the Various Budgets
This example is for a low income couple working full-time.

* The couple's joint income before deductions is £30,000 per year
* They pay taxes and NI totaling £2,834
* Their take home pay is £27,166
* Their essential expenses, excluding pay deductions, are £18,410 per year
* Their committed expenses (essential expenses, tax ,NI, gym membership, etc) are £21,600


### The 60% Solution

If they use the 60% solution with their gross income for the year they should allocate:

    60% - £18,000 for committed expenses
    10% -  £3,000 for retirement savings
    10% -  £3,000 for long-term savings
    10% -  £3,000 for short-term savings
    10% -  £3,000 for fun

However, what they can actually allocate:

    72% - £21,600 for committed expenses
    10% -  £3,000 for retirement savings
     6% -  £1,800 for long-term savings
     6% -  £1,800 for short-term savings
     6% -  £1,800 for fun

This might be easier to think about using the net income instead, in which case they should allocate:

    60% - £16,299 for committed expenses, excluding pay deductions
    10% -  £2,716 for retirement savings
    10% -  £2,716 for long-term savings
    10% -  £2,716 for short-term savings
    10% -  £2,716 for fun

Again, more realistically this could be

    69% - £18,745 for committed expenses, excluding pay deductions
    10% -  £2,716 for retirement savings
     7% -  £1,901 for long-term savings
     7% -  £1,901 for short-term savings
     7% -  £1,901 for fun



### The 50/20/30 Budget

If they use the 50/20/30 budget with their net income for the year they should allocate:

    50% - £13,583 for essentials
    20% -  £5,433 for financial goals
    30% -  £8,149 for non-essentials

However, what they can actually allocate:

    68% - £18,472 for essentials
    17% -  £4,618 for financial goals
    15% -  £4,074 for non-essentials

### The 80/20 Budget

If they use the 80/20 budget with their net income for the year they should allocate:

    20% -  £5,433 for financial goals
    80% - £21,732 for everything else

They can actually allocate:

    17% -  £4,618 for financial goals
    83% - £22,547 for everything else

## Where Now?
We have seen how the percentages will not work for everyone, however they are a good starting point to help decide what to do with our income.  As the budgets become progressively simpler it becomes harder to make informed decisions as to how best to allocate our money.  This maybe less of a problem for people with lower expenses or higher income, however many of us need the greater clarity that the 60% solution can provide.

Whichever way we budget, we can see that all three methods effectively recommend putting aside 20% for retirement/long-term savings.  If we pay into a pension through work then we could factor this into our retirement saving.  Overtime we may well want to work out how we can increase our earnings or reduce our spending to increase the amount we save.  If we have paid off a mortgage for example then we may well be able to save near 30%, 40% or even 50% of our income.

When looking at the discretionary spending whether it is classed as fun money, or non-essential spending we should ensure that our current account doesn't drop below a predetermined buffer so that we don't risk going overdrawn.

To help us reach our financial goals it would be helpful to automate the savings.  If this isn't possible then set a date each month, normally just after pay day, to review and make transfers into our saving accounts/pension.

Now that we have some figures to work with we can better understand our finances.  This can act as a great motivator to help us decide if we need to find ways of reducing some of our expenses or increasing our income.
